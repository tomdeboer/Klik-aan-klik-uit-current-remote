Klik-aan-klik-uit remote control with CT-sensor
---

***Note: This project is currently a work in progress; not all systems are functional..***

The goal of this project is to provide a blueprint for building a klik-aan-klik-uit remote with a current sensing input. The current input is provided by a general CT-sensor and generates a voltage that is picked up by the microcontroller. If a current is detected, the klik-aan-klik-uit switch is switched on. The opposite happens when the current is removed. Aditionally, the generated power can be used to charge a lithium cell.

The system is built using widely available components and parts and cane be easily created. The source code at this point contains some uC specific (ATtiny85) control logic, but at some point in the future other uC's will be supported. It is easy to add your own anyway.
